When your order is delivered you may return any item and receive a full refund if you consider that the difference between the price charged and the guide price shown on the Grocery website is unacceptable.</p>

      <p>Although we will always try to cater for your orders, an order of large quantities of a line can only be fulfilled at the discretion of the store.
